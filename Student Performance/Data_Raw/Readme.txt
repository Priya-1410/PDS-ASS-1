gender                        categorical     The gender of the student (male/female)
race/ethnicity                categorical     The student's race or ethnicity categorized into groups (A, B, C, D, E)
parental level of education   categorical     The highest level of education attained by the student's parents
lunch                         categorical     Type of lunch received by the student (standard or free/reduced)
test preparation course.      categorical     Whether the student completed a test preparation course (completed/none)
math score                    numerical       The score obtained by the student in the math exam (0-100 scale)
reading score                 numerical       The score obtained by the student in the reading exam (0-100 scale)

Visualization1:
Distribution of Math Scores by Gender:
-The histogram shows the distribution of math scores for both males and females.
-This makes it easy to compare the spread and central tendencies of scores across genders, revealing whether one group consistently scores higher or has a broader range of scores.

Visualization2:
Average Subject Scores by Lunch Type:
-The bar chart visualizes the average scores in math, reading, and writing for students based on whether they receive standard or free/reduced lunch.
-It highlights the potential influence of socioeconomic factors (as represented by lunch type) on academic performance across all subjects.

Visualization3:
Math Scores Distribution by Parental Education Level:
-The boxplot shows the distribution of math scores based on parental education levels.
-This makes it easier to observe any trends where higher parental education may correlate with higher student performance, and whether there are outliers or significant variation within each category.

Visualization4:
Correlation Heatmap of Subject Scores:
-The heatmap visualizes the correlation between math, reading, and writing scores.
-This simplifies the task of identifying strong or weak correlations between different subjects, showing that scores in one subject tend to be positively associated with others.

Visualization5:
Test Preparation Course Completion by Race/Ethnicity:
-The count plot displays the number of students who completed the test preparation course by race/ethnicity.
-It provides insight into the distribution of test preparation across different demographic groups, which may reveal disparities in access to or completion of such resources.
